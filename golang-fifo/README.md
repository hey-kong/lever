This is a modern cache implementation, **inspired** by the following papers, provides high efficiency.

- **SIEVE** | [SIEVE is Simpler than LRU: an Efficient Turn-Key Eviction Algorithm for Web Caches](https://junchengyang.com/publication/nsdi24-SIEVE.pdf) (NSDI'24)
- **S3-FIFO** | [FIFO queues are all you need for cache eviction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613147) (SOSP'23)

This offers state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability compared to other LRU-based cache algorithms.

## Basic Usage
```go
import "github.com/scalalang2/golang-fifo/sieve"

size := 1e5
cache := sieve.New[string, string](size)

cache.Set("hello", "world")
val, _ := cache.Get("hello") 
fmt.Printf("value: %s", val) // => "world"
```

## Benchmark Result
The benchmark result were obtained using [go-cache-benchmark](https://github.com/scalalang2/go-cache-benchmark)

**SIEVE** delivers both high hit rates and the highest QPS(queries per seconds) compared to other LRU-based caches. 
Additionally, It approximately improves 30% for efficiency than a simple LRU cache.

Increasing efficiency means not only reducing cache misses, 
but also reducing the demand for heavy operations such as backend database access, which lowers the mean latency.

While LRU promotes accessed objects to the head of the queue, 
requiring a potentially slow lock acquisition, 
SIEVE only needs to update a single bit upon a cache hit. 
This update can be done with a significantly faster reader lock, leading to increased performance.

## Apendix

<details>
<summary>Why LRU Cache is not good enough?</summary>

- LRU is often implemented with a doubly linked list and a hash table, requiring two pointers per cache entry,
  which becomes large overhead when the object is small.
- It promotes objects to the head of the queue upon cache hit, which performs at least six random memory accesses
  protected by lock, which limits the scalability.

<summary>Brief overview of SIEVE & S3-FIFO</summary>

Various workloads typically follows **Power law distribution (e.g. Zipf's law)** as shown in the following figure.

![zipflaw_discovered_by_realworld](./docs/zipf_law_discovered_by_realworld_traces.png)

The analysis reveals that most requests are "one-hit-wonders", which means it's accessed only once.
Consequently, a cache eviction strategy should quickly remove most objects after insertion.

**S3-FIFO** and **SIEVE** achieves this goal with simplicity, efficiency, and scalability using simple FIFO queue only.
